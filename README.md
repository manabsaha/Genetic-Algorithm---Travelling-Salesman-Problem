# Genetic-Algorithm---Travelling-Salesman-Problem
We tried to approach towards a solution of Travelling Salesman Problem using Genetic Algorithm. The genetic algorithm produces optimal solution from the initial population stage to successive population stages. It approaches the problem using the process of natural selection and survival of the fittest. The one with the best path cost is considered for successive generation. After nth generations, the evaluation process is completed and the most fittest one is considered as the optimal solution for the travelling salesman problem.
